# Factions System Project - README

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a faction system within a simulated geopolitical environment. The core goal is to implement a system where countries can form factions based on mutual relations, allowing them to pool resources, fight wars, and form alliances. Eventually, the factions will influence wars, diplomacy, and general gameplay.

## Features Overview
- **Faction Formation:** Countries with mutual relations over 50 can propose the formation of a faction.
- **Mandatory Acceptance:** If one country proposes a faction and the other has a high enough relation and is not already in a faction, they will automatically join.
- **Faction Wars:** Wars will be fought between factions, instead of individual countries.
- **Visual Representation:** In the future, a visual display of faction membership and faction wars will be added to enhance user experience.

## To-Do List

### Core Features
1. **Faction Proposal Mechanism**
   - [ ] Implement logic for checking if relations between two countries exceed 50.
   - [ ] Create function to propose a faction when mutual relation requirement is met.
   - [ ] Add condition that countries must not already belong to another faction.

2. **Faction Acceptance**
   - [ ] Ensure that once a faction is proposed, the second country must join if not in a faction.
   - [ ] Prevent faction formation if either country is already in a different faction.

3. **Faction Membership Management**
   - [ ] Develop data structure for representing factions and their members.
   - [ ] Implement functions to add countries to factions and track membership.

### War System
1. **Faction-Based War Logic**
   - [ ] Develop framework for declaring wars between factions instead of countries.
   - [ ] Create functionality to declare war on behalf of all members in a faction when the faction goes to war.
   - [ ] Implement a check to see if all members of a faction are ready to engage in war.

### Visual Representation
1. **Visual Display (Future Work)**
   - [ ] Design a way to visually represent factions and their members (e.g., faction borders, different colors, flags).
   - [ ] Add visual indicators for wars involving factions.

## Future Features
- **Diplomatic Options**: Add options for countries to leave a faction or refuse a proposal based on additional conditions.
- **Faction Relations**: Implement a system where entire factions can have relations with other factions.
- **Economic Alliances**: Add economic benefits for countries within the same faction.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if applicable).
3. Run the main script to initiate the simulation.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Please make pull requests for new features or fixes.
- Follow the existing coding standards.
- Clearly document any new functionality added.
